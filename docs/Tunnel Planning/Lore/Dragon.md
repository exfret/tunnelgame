There is a dragon in [[Layer 4]]. You can battle it there, though it is very difficult and not required. Moving between [[Layer 6]] and [[Layer 7]], however, requires defeating the dragon.

I'm thinking that battling the dragon should involve cues in the reading that indicate what it is about to do, in addition to a lot of skill checks.
