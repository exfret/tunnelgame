2. [[Layer 2]]
	1. Suddenly flat except for the occasional craggy rock structure
	2. Requires a [[Blue Pass]]
3. [[Layer 3]]

	2. Requires a [[Yellow Pass]]
4. [[Layer 4]]
	1. Extremely tall mountains that almost touch the roof of the [[Tunnel]]
	2. Requires a [[Pioneer Pass]]

6. [[Layer 6]]
	1. Shifting and hard to describe; foggy and dark
