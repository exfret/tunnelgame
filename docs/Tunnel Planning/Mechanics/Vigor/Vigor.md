You have a certain amount of [[Variables/Vigor/Vigor|Vigor]], which represents your overall enthusiasm and life outlook. You can increase it via long rests at the orphanage, which decreases [[Experience]] by a certain amount. It is used as currency for a few things, such as [[Tunnel]] expeditions, and especially [[Mechanics/Jobs/Jobs|Jobs]]. There is a [[Max Vigor]], which can be upgraded later, especially with [[Mechanics/Vigor/Vigor Points]].
