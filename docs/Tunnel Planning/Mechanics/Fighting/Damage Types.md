Damage can come in a variety of types. The main ones are as follows:
* Physical: Normal damage dealt by weapons like swords
	* Physical damage is by far the most common type, and will be your main damage source.
* Chemical: Dealt by acid, poisons, and disease
	* Most chemical damage is dealth over time, making resistances to it rather effective.
* Incendiary: Includes fire and explosion-based damage
	* Even when creatures have high resistances to incendiary damage, they can usually still be damaged with it due to explosions causing a lot of damage at a time.
* Magical: Includes mental damage inflicted by magic
	* Creatures usually are not resistant to this unless they are inanimate/stupid or very powerful.
* Void: Special type of damage unlocked later
