You can engage in [[Locations/Orphanage/Volunteering/Volunteering|Volunteering]] at the orphanage, which advances certain storylines and gives something to do between expedition trips. See that link for the specifics of each trip. You can do at most one volunteering trip between expeditions, and you can't "skip" doing volunteering twice in a row (so there are at most two expeditions between volunteering trips). So, by the time you embark on your last training expedition (your 16th one as according to [[Next Expeditions]]), you can have at most 15 of the volunteering trips (between encounters), and need at least 7.
