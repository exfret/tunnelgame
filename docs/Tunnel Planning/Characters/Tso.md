Tso is [[Characters/Orphans/George]]'s dad, a famous Tunnel adventurer. While he disappeared a couple years before the main events of the story, some notes and other things you find in [[Layer 2]] lead George to believe that his father is still alive somewhere in the Tunnel, and to go looking for him. Unfortunately, George's journey does not end well and he is petrified.
