The next few encounters maybe shouldn't unlock things explicitly, but they should be a main source of experience, which then unlocks things. The training pools will be different from the normal pools, and more restricted. I'm thinking there could be a timer between training expeditions, so "[[Characters/George|George]] can rest". They could maybe go as follows:

* Expedition 2-3:
	* In the plains, but this time random encounters (maybe enforce a more "interesting" encounter, so not just lemens/rosalia?)
- Expedition 4-5:
	- These could be in the [[Hills]], and a random encounter would be chosen (possibly from a smaller pool due to it being a training encounter).
- Expedition 6-8:
	- Like the past few expeditions, but the player gets to choose where they want to go.
- Expedition 9-10:
	- This would be in the [[Woods]], which are slightly more dangerous, thus why they are come third. At this point, the player should be a couple weeks into the game, ideally with some rest between expeditions.
- Expedition 11-15:
	- From here on out, you can choose which of all three areas you want, but [[Characters/George|George]] starts making you get your own [[Equipment]].
- Expedition 16:
	- This is the final expedition, where you are given the [[Clackadoo Feather]].
