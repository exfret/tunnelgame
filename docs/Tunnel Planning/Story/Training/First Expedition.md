Unlike all other expeditions, the first one is pre-scripted. It is located in the [[Plains]].

The first day, you gather [[Items/Flowers/Lemen|Lemens]]. There is a scene with a hill where [[Characters/Orphans/George|George]] shows [[Characters/Orphans/Lily|Lily]] a beautiful [[Items/Flowers/Lemen|Lemen]] field. There is an option to get distracted by something midway through the day, when you and [[Characters/Orphans/George|George]] have split up for a bit. I'm still wondering what it should be. This would be the first "real" choice in the story, so I want it to have some impact. I also want some sort of event to happen in the evening.

The second day, you gather [[Items/Flowers/Rosalia|Rosalia]]. That night, you have the option to investigate a noise, or something like that. If you go, [[Characters/Orphans/George|George]] chastises you for putting yourself in danger.

The third day, you search for [[Petunal Blossoms]], but are largely unsuccessful, since they don't grow in patches like [[Items/Flowers/Lemen|Lemens]] and [[Items/Flowers/Rosalia|Rosalia]].

After expedition 1, you probably should unlock the following:
- [[Experience]]
- [[Mechanics/Vigor/Vigor|Vigor]]
- The [[Rooms]] in the [[Orphanage]], and ability to visit and talk to all orphans; this includes your own room
- The [[Orphanage]]'s [[Commons]] hallway, with the [[Study]] initially unlocked, and maybe one other thing that I haven't decided yet
- The ability to participate in [[Mechanics/Volunteering|Volunteering]] trips
- [[Town]]
	- The [[Market]] with [[General Store]] and possibly another shop
	- The ability to get a [[Mechanics/Jobs/Jobs|Job]] as a [[Lousy Farmhand]]
