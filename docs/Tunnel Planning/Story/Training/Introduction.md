Description: George is standing at the dusty entrance to the orphanage, his ruffled brown hair blending with the oak double round-top door that leads outside. He's flipping a coin to pass the time as he waits for you to finish packing for your trip to the Tunnel with him.

- The second choice directs the player's attention to the statistics view on the right.
- The third discusses [[Characters/Orphans/Lily|Lily's]] desire to become a great [[Tunnel]] adventurer and provide for the [[Orphanage]].
