Ghosts have their own culture. They worship [[Queen Rosaline]], hoping to summon her back as a ghost so that they can invade and rule the [[Lore/Dome]] once more. They appreciate [[Items/Flowers/Rosalia|Rosalia]], as it was [[Queen Rosaline|Queen Rosaline's]] favorite flower (thus why it was named after her).
