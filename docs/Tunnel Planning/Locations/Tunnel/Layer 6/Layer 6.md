This is where [[Tunnel Sickness]] starts to be noticeable, and as a result, many [[Crimson Pass]] holders turn into recluses or go insane. This sickness is part of the reason for the poor documentation, but it could also be due to the layer genuinely shifting in its layout over time. It's not made any better by the fact that the jungle of layer 5 has an impenetrable fog toward the end, and that in layer 6 the lighting from the Dome and first few layers of the Tunnel fades.
