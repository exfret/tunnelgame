Description: You pass a middle aged traveler with light brown hair.

The traveler's name is [[Locations/Tunnel/Layer 1/Plains/Henry/Henry|Henry]], and he initially gives you an [[Artifacts|Artifact]]. I'm not sure what to do when you see him again.

Maybe Henry isn't always here, in which case this could alternate between the backpack or dagger encounter.
