After you go through all visits, it loops back to the first visit.

First Visit:
* You find a [[Dagger]]. If you're with [[Characters/Orphans/George|George]], he doesn't allow you to pick it up. You're warned if you pick it up while too young to engage in [[Mechanics/Fighting/Fighting|Fighting]], and picking it up still can lead to consequences. If you leave the dagger their three times, then the fourth time, someone will have picked it up and it won't be there anymore. I'm not sure what should be in its place yet.

Second visit:
* You find a note and a gift with a lot of flowers. If with [[Characters/Orphans/George|George]], he lets you keep all of them. The note should only appear once, though I'm not sure what should be after it.

Third Visit:
* You find a backpack with supplies (I haven't decided exactly what supplies). If you pick it up, some big dudes come and try to beat you up. If with [[Characters/Orphans/George|George]] or with high enough fighting skill, you get away unscathed. If you haven't picked up the backpack twice, then by the third time it's not there anymore, though I'm not sure what should be in its place.
