This is a [[Next Expeditions|Training Encounter]].

You find a massive [[Items/Flowers/Starblossom|Starblossom]] in the woods. If with [[Characters/Orphans/George|George]], he harvests and gives it to you, showing you the methods he uses, giving you the knowledge part for how to harvest them (but not the tool).
