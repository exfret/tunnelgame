This is a [[Next Expeditions|Training Encounter]].

A scurry of [[World Features/Creatures/Squirrel|Squirrels]] protects this part of the [[Woods]]. If you're with [[Characters/Orphans/George|George]], he beats them up, but doesn't allow you to venture deeper into their territory. In return for not venturing further, he gives you something, but I'm not sure what that should be yet.

Deeper in the territory is a [[Squirrel Prince]]. You can defeat them in a duel for personally loyal [[Squirrel Followers]], or back this prince's claim to the throne.
