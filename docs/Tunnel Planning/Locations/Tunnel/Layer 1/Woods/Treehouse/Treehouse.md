This is a [[Next Expeditions|Training Encounter]].

This is a clearing where you can build the ultimate treehouse. Building up the structure requires [[Building Materials]], and occasionally other things.

If you come here with [[Characters/Orphans/George|George]], there is a more limited selection of things to build, but he offers to help out, allowing you to do things with fewer [[Building Materials]] (new cost is 50% of old rounded up).

Choices:
* To start the treehouse, you must build a ladder for 2 [[Building Materials]]
* In the meantime, you can plant a [[Items/Flowers/Lemen|Lemen]] garden for 1 [[Items/Flowers/Lemen|Lemen]] and 2 [[Building Materials]], which gives a [[Items/Flowers/Lemen|Lemen]] each time you visit
* You can also build an Affirmation Station, which will give a positive affirmation each time you visit, this costs 1 [[Building Materials]]

Once you have the ladder, the following options open up:
* A flag for 2 [[Building Materials]], which allows you to visit your base directly the first day of any expedition (you can still come across it randomly)
* A base for the treehouse, which costs 3 [[Building Materials]]
* For 4 [[Building Materials]], and [[Interaction Station]], which allows more things to build and also to interact with various parts of the treehouse
	* You can rest on a branch of the treehouse once per visit, restoring 1 [[Mechanics/Vigor/Vigor]] per expedition, but not past 5 [[Mechanics/Vigor/Vigor]] even if your max is higher; this can be overcome by building a hammock for 8 [[Building Materials]]
	* A [[Training Station]] for like 6 [[Building Materials]] can then be built, which allows you to increase fighting skills (though I'm not sure of the exact way this will work yet)
	* If you've discovered the [[Squirrel Wars]], you can build a [[Combat Station]] for maybe 10 [[Building Materials]] in order to send out personally loyal squirrels to attack areas/people/etc. for you (maybe I should make this require a fence or something just to make it a bit more gated)

After you build the base of the treehouse you are able to survey the land and build other things in the clearing
* You can build a firepit for 5 [[Building Materials]]
* You can build a fence for 5 [[Building Materials]]
* If you've built a lemen garden and an [[Interaction Station]], you can also upgrade the garden to something, either a "normal" [[Mechanics/Gardens|Garden]] or maybe one that gives [[Petunal Blossoms]]
* Treehouse walls require [[Construction I]] and another 5 [[Building Materials]]
