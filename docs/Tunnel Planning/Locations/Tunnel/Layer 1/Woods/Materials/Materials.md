This is a [[Next Expeditions|Training Encounter]].

The first time you appear here, you see a pile of [[Building Materials]]. (Note that [[Characters/Orphans/George|George]] can be with you at this time; maybe he gets you extra [[Building Materials]]). The second time, you find an [[Acorns|Acorn]]. The third time, you find two dead [[World Features/Creatures/Squirrel|Squirrels]]. An elderly squirrel, [[Peasant]], pops up and tells you about the [[Squirrel Wars]]. If [[Characters/Orphans/George|George]] is with you at that time, he gets distracted and doesn't believe you later when you tell him about it.

I'm thinking you could come across several people depending on logic. The materials pile then would have a social atmosphere to it. I want the logic to be decipherable but not straightforward.

Possibilities:
- [[Sarah]]
- [[George]], if you've finished training with him, can show up (not sure about logic)
- [[Peasant]] could be randomly encountered
- [[Mark]] could be encountered, maybe with special text if you haven't encountered him yet
- Maybe if no one is there, you gather extra building materials due to not being distracted? Or fewer due to being lonely?
- Not sure what to happen after those encounters, maybe should loop, etc.

# Sarah

A gardener, [[Sarah]], stops by to scavenge for [[Building Materials]] for her garden. She explains that she is missing a [[Shovel]]. This gives the option to lend one to her, which sets your [[Shovel]] level to 0. The player can get more [[Shovel]] level in the meantime, but it should be difficult-ish to get the shovel high enough level in time for the next time you come across the building material pile. This time, [[Sarah]] is not there, but there is a spot to dig. Then, the time after, [[Sarah]] returns and gives you back the [[Shovel]], but it is now much higher level, because she likes to return things "better off than how she got it". This sets your [[Shovel]] to that level, unless you already got a higher level [[Shovel]], in which case [[Sarah]] comments and keeps the old one. With your new higher level [[Shovel]], you can also still dig whatever was there before.
