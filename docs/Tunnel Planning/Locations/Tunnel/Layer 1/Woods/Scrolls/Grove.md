First Visit:
- You get the text:
	- An ancient scroll crunches under your feet as you approach the woods.
- Then, you unlock a specific [[Research]]. I haven't decided which one yet.

Second Visit:
* You get the text:
	- This time, when you walk through, there are scrolls everywhere. But they are in an undecipherable language. Alerted to your presence, these scrolls fly into the air and wrap you up like a mummy until you can't escape or even breath. You pass out. When you wake up, you notice that you have forgotten some things.
- After this, you lose a [[Research]] (I'm still deciding on which one). It will probably be the one you got from the first visit, just to ensure you actually have the one you're supposed to lose.
- If you have high enough observation/fighting skills, maybe an option to defeat them on the first try.

Third+ Visit (Scrolls Undefeated):
- There's an option to do [[Mechanics/Fighting/Fighting|Fighting]] against the scrolls.
- If you lose, you also lose the same [[Research]] as above again.
- If you win, you get some bonus related to researching, and also the following text:
	- You rip the scrolls to shreds. It seems they were guarding an ancient locked shack back here.
- Upon winning, you are presented with the options from "Third+ Visit (Scrolls Defeated)"

Third+ Visit (Scrolls Defeated):
- You get the text:
	- You find the place you defeated those scrolls in such a badass way.
- Then there's an option to go into the [[Shack]] if you have the [[Ancient Shack Key]].
- Maybe I could have other options too?
