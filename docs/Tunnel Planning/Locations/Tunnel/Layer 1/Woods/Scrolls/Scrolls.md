Description: Ahead of you is a grove that is dark and gloomy like my soul. Not your soul, mine. The narrator's. Anyways...

If you've made a visit to the [[Grove]], you get the following warning:
* As you continue, you hear a hissing from within the [[Grove]], like, well, pieces of paper hissing. Like they came from a Harry Potter novel and they're all magical. Not that the pieces of paper in the published works of JK Rowling are magical, I mean like if they were in the world Harry Potter.

Choices:
- Visit the [[Grove]]
- Walk around, which leads to the [[Lake]]
- I'm wondering if there should be a third option of something to do, as well; if there is, one choice could be walking around to the right, and the other walking around to the left
