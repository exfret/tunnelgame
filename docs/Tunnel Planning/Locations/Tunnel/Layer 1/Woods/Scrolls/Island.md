Description: You arrive at the {scene = "tunnel", layer = 1, encounter = "scrolls", area = "lake", subarea = "island"} portion of my story. Congratulations!

Note: The {scene = ...} thing does not actually correspond to any bits of code; it's just meant to give the player a laugh.

Choices:
- If you have a good enough [[Shovel]], you can dig for a reward. Maybe a bunch of [[Coin]], but something else special like an [[Artifacts]] might also work.
