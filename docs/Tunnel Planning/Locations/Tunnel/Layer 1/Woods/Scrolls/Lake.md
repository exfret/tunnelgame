Description: You walk around and come across a lake, that you also have to walk around. It's really muddy here, actually, and the mosquitos whiz around like crazy. Out in the middle of the pond, you can see an island with a big "X" on it. If only the lake was frozen over (hint hint), so that you could go investigate.

Choices:
- If the current [[Seasons]] is Winter, you can cross the Lake to the [[Island]].
- If not, there is a selectable once option to swim, that just gives the following text:
	- You realize that the author thought it would be a neat mechanic for the island to only be available when the lake is frozen over, so you decide to keep them happy by not swimming now.
- I'm not sure what other choices to put, but something to do when it's not frozen over would be good.
