Description: You come across some rocks rising up from the ground. They stick straight up and lean on each other like a house of cards, leaving a hole between them. This hole is the entrance to a cave with an abyssal, dark interior. The ground slopes downward toward the hole, as if to suck you in.

Subareas:
- [[Around]]
- [[Inside]] (requires 1 [[Lemen Lantern]])
- [[Top]]

Extra choices:
- Gather Resource
	- Right now, this is just [[Building Materials]], but could be something more intricate as a fourth choice as well
	- I may have it related to building a rock collection in the future
	- The fourth choice is here so you can spend all day at the cave, choosing different options, even if you don't have a [[Lemen Lantern]]
