This is a [[Next Expeditions|Training Encounter]].

Description: You come across some rocks that stick straight up and lean on each other like a house of cards, leaving a hole between them. This hole is the entrance to a dark cave. The ground slopes toward the hole, as if to invite you in.

Subareas:
- [[Around]]
- [[Inside]] (requires 1 [[Lemen Lantern]])
- [[Locations/Tunnel/Layer 1/Hills/Cave/Top]]

Extra choices:
- Gather Resource
	- Right now, this is just [[Building Materials]], but could be something more intricate as a fourth choice as well
	- I may have it related to building a rock collection in the future
	- The fourth choice is here so you can spend all day at the cave, choosing different options, even if you don't have a [[Lemen Lantern]]
