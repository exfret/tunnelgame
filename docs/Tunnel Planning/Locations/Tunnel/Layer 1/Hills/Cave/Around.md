First Visit:
- Find some flowers, right now 2 [[Petunal Blossoms]]

Later Visits: You randomly get one of the following...
* (50% chance) A single [[Petunal Blossoms|Petunal Blossom]]
* (25% chance) Find [[Alice]] doing patrols
* (25% chance) You find some tracks for [[Tracking]]

I'm thinking these should be bucketed, with a pool of size 4. Alice does not appear (and is replaced by tracking) if you're with [[Characters/Orphans/George|George]].
