This is a [[Next Expeditions|Training Encounter]].

Description: You come across a small, but very steep cliff blocking your path.

If you're training with [[Characters/Orphans/George|George]], he insists first on going left, then right, then up (via elevator), then allowing you to choose a direction (saying you should explore all the different ways to get to places).

Choices:
- [[Left]]
- [[Right]]
- Elevator -- Only mentioned in the choices and the picture, without an explanation for why there's just an elevator in the middle of nowhere, as if it's normal; takes a phase of the day because the "elevator pauses in the middle" (if with [[Characters/Orphans/George|George]] he says it's normal to pause, as if he's taken it before), and leads to [[Locations/Tunnel/Layer 1/Hills/Cliff/Top/Top|Top]]
	- The reason it's so slow is that it's run by [[Mark|Mark's]] muscle alone and he gets tired near the middle and needs to rest.
- Run up -- Needs extremely high [[Athleticism]], also leads to [[Locations/Tunnel/Layer 1/Hills/Cliff/Top/Top|Top]] but without wasting a phase of the day.
	- If you choose this, you get the text "It's so much quicker to run up a vertical cliff face that you wonder why more people don't do this."
	- I'm thinking of allowing most stuff in an encounter to be done in one phase of the day unless you do something that clearly takes time, so I might need to revise this
- Knock on the [[Maintenance]] room door, which leads you straight to a [[Conversation]] with [[Mark]]
- Unlock the maintenance room door with the [[Elevator Maintenance Key]], which lets you [[Snoop]]
