This is a [[Next Expeditions|Training Encounter]].

Description: You come across a small, but very steep cliff blocking your path.

If you're training with [[Characters/Orphans/George|George]], he insists first on going left, then right, then up, then allowing you to choose a direction (saying you should explore all the different ways to get to places).
