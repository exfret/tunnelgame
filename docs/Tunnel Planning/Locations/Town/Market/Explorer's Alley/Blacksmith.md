The blacksmith, named [[Marty]], helps with upgrading your [[Tools]]. There are other beginning game ways to get some levels, but he's the main way to get tools to a middling-level early on. He is the brother of [[Mark]], and will tell you about how you can just knock if you mention the elevator at the [[Cliff]] encounter to him after coming across it. Maybe this can happen with a choice to tell him about your adventures.

Choices:
- Upgrade tools...
- Tell him about my adventures
