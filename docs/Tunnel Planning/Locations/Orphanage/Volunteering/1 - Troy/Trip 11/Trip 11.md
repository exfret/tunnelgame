Another trip to [[Karo's Farm]], maybe with some choices... if you've been semi-nice, maybe [[Karo]] offers you some lemonade and inside work, making your life easier and restoring [[Mechanics/Vigor/Vigor|Vigor]]? Maybe [[Karo]] can talk to you and you can get to know him and [[Characters/Orphans/Troy|Troy]] through him more. Also, maybe you get to explore the house or just around.
