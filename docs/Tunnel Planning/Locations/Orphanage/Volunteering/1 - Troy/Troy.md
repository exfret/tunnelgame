These are trips when [[Troy]] and [[Karo]] are still at [[Karo's Farm]]. There needs to be at least 15 or so of these because you need the [[Clackadoo Feather]] from [[Characters/Orphans/George|George]] for having completed training first, and according to [[Next Expeditions]] that can take up to 16 expeditions, or 15 volunteering trips if the player is going between every expedition. But since I'd like some time to allow them to sell the [[Clackadoo Feather]], I think maybe having like 18 trips would be good, with the disappearence triggered (and able to be discerned) at that 19th one, where you don't return to [[Karo's Farm]].

I also need to figure out how to interlace the volunteering with Tunnel exploring stuffs. Maybe more spots from [[Town]] that you can actually visit now or later could be used.
