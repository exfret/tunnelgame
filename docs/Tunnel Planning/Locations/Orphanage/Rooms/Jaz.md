Description: Jaz is wearing her usual mischievous grin on a face freckled similarly to yours surrounded by a bob of black hair. "Whatcha want, miss?"

(Note: I can drop some of the words once I draw her, but leaving them here for reference).

[[Characters/Orphans/Jaz|Jaz]] offers a small selection of items for some things from the [[Tunnel]]
- For 1 [[Petunal Blossoms|Petunal Blossom]], you can get validation, which leads to her saying one of the following:
	- You're cool. I guess.
	- You have an okay vibe.
	- Look in my mirror. In there is a beautiful, wonderful girl with a promising future. That's me. Isn't that neat?
	- You'll probably be forgotten. Hey, that's a good thing for some people!
	- I'm pretty great. Wait, you wanted me to validate you? Oh.
	- I'm lovin' that grimy-face, hair-full-of-knots look you got going.
	- You're nice.
	- Honestly, you really set a good standard. Like, when I compare where I am to where you are, I just feel so much better. About myself, that is.
- For 5 [[Coin]], you can get taught some [[Sneakiness]], though the price raises and then you can't buy it the third time because [[Characters/Orphans/Jaz|Jaz]] has no more to offer
- For 1 [[Items/Flowers/Starblossom|Starblossom]], you can get an [[Orphanage Courtyard Key]]

I'm thinking some more story-esque option for Jaz as well, like inviting her somewhere.
