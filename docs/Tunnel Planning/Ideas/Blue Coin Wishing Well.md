There is a wishing well in an encounter where you can throw in some number of [[Coin||Coins]] for a [[Items/Currencies/Blue Coin|Blue Coin]]. The number of coins you have to throw in increases by one each time, then when it would be 5 jumps to another very different number with the text "You thought it would be 5 wouldn't you?", then varies erratically with different messages like "is there a pattern?" It eventually repeats. The exact sequence of numbers of [[Coin|Coins]] needed is used elsewhere, like in a long keypad sequence or something such for a well-hidden secret.
