Very, very rarely, an explorer will find a purple coin among a stack of [[Items/Currencies/Blue Coin|Blue Coins]]. These hold great value, even among those who find little value in blue coins. They are even more valuable than [[Clackadoo Feather|Clackadoo Feathers]], by quite a considerable amount.
