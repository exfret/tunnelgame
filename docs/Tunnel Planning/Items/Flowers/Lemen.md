Description: Bulbous glowing flowers from the Tunnel, often used for lighting. Once picked, they spoil quickly.

As you gather lemens, you also increase your [[Lemen Gather Skill]], which leads to your lemen count increasing quadratically over time. To balance this, lemens also have the [[Spoiling]] mechanic, so you can't actually horde them too much. They are often used for [[Lighting]].

Lemens can be gathered en masse with the [[Locations/Tunnel/Layer 1/Plains/Lemen/Lemen|Lemen Encounter]], and then sold at the [[General Store]]. In order to prevent things from getting too ridiculous, I think a cap on [[Lemen Gather Skill]] until you get a certain [[Research]] would be good, and then later a cap on the amount that the [[General Store]] buys at a time. Still, selling [[Items/Flowers/Lemen|Lemens]] should be a good source of income (though not as reliable as [[Mechanics/Jobs/Jobs]]).

If you visit the [[Market]] with enough lemens, a mysterious man tells you about the [[Lemen Society]], a group of people who essentially worship lemens and strive to have as many as possible.

A more prominent use is for [[Lemen Lantern|Lemen Lanterns]], for exploration of dark areas. Later dark areas require more and more lemen lanterns to pierce through the darkness.

I'm thinking as a fourth use, when you get them en masse, you can start using them at a potion shop in a later [[Layers|Layer]].
