Description: Petunal blossoms are skinny purple flowers with yellow flecks on their petals. The petals are often dried and said to be very nutritrious and yummy when used as seasoning that way. Though some people even eat them raw!

Petunal blossoms are gathered in small amounts as miscellaneous rewards from some encounters. They can be renewable, but not just easily gotten from the same location every time like [[Rosalia]] and [[Items/Flowers/Lemen|Lemens]]. However, they are the most easily farmed in the [[Gardens]] among these three flowers.

Petunal blossoms are used in the [[Petunal Festival]], which doesn't happen often, though a *lot* of petunal blossoms are used for this.

Early on, I'm planning a bird seed shop that can turn petunal blossoms into bird seed, which can then be used at a bird encounter to get a bird friend. Maybe the [[Petunal Festival]] can even involve some birds from the [[Tunnel]].
