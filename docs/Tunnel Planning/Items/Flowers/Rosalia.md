Description: Rosalia is a type of flower with deep red petals. It is found in the Tunnel, where it grows best. Its leaves are often ground up and for a variety of teas.

The major source of rosalia is the [[Plains]] (though I haven't figured out yet how to differentiate gathering rosalia from the [[Locations/Tunnel/Layer 1/Plains/Lemen/Lemen|Lemen]] encounter).

In the beginning it is used primarily for [[Research]] in the study, as [[Mabel]] turns your fresh leaves into high-end teas to help fund the orphanage. There is a [[Tea Shop]] in town where rosalia can be used (but I'm not sure what exactly to do here). They are also relevant to [[Ghosts]].
