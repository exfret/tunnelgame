Currently:
  - per_cost etc. logic

134. Fix back command... it went back to the root of the story once?
133. Definitely do search along for blocks with certain names (maybe option to disable)
132. Warning for choice/effects without gotos
131. Persistent stats about a story, like how much completion you've achieved across all your runs of it
130. Composite repo logic that looks in both built-in and non-built-in stories
129. Print error for too many args in commands?
128. Test for stop commands
127. Compound instructions (separated by ;?)
126. Fix goto command (I think broken in choice effects)
125. Warnings for = in text (for set statements)
124. Var printing in text of choices?
123. Test dereferencing abilities
122. Ability to name vars based on the current block?
121. Change gosub to persist through choices
120. Create/Global keyword for locally defined vars
119. Give inform a look for object features
118. "all the eggs" talks about all eggs
117. Warning for choices that lead to "todo" sections
116. Special ways to access variables, for example, from different scopes with custom parsing of variables in {} curly braces
115. Tag/filter system... filter only for blocks with a certain tag when doing instructions/commands
114. Make list of definitive features to test
113. Ability to organize vars more into "blocks" that are just for organizational purposes
112. Tags about story elements for debugging? What would these do? Maybe built-in changelogs and messages.
111. Make random number generator deterministic
109. Attach which game "id" each save is from
108. Overwrite confirmation for saving over an old file?
107. Default load value too?
106. State organization overhaul?
105. Exception handling when load tries to load something from a different story
104. Implement pytest test cases for shops
103. Catch exceptions from run command
102. Colored title text for intro
101. Print unlock function
100. Going back with story re-running
99. Make headers/footers proper blocks too
98. Execute command for executing instructions from command console (more flexibility with changing state, etc.)
97. Separator instruction
96. Local flags
95. "Disable-able" choices
94. Make _footer's back into distinguished blocks not macros (or maybe a special type of block)
92. Info tag for instructions when you're in a block/reminders (maybe combine with actions)
91. Add footers to effects sections too (maybe move back to ending footers)
90. Titles for locations
89. Fix gameparser for requirement specifications
88. Make sure "help" string is up to date
87. Change "stop" to "wait" statement? Maybe "pause". Make wait keep execution stack and stop get rid of it. How to do headers?
85. Use python ast module to check for undefined variables
81. Error on choices that are more than one word
80. Iteration loops (iterate through a list and do something for each thing in the list)
77. _args overhaul to use list of variable dicts, not just numbers
75. Should "stops" deconstruct the call stack like they do now? In general, how could we do choices within a gosub?
74. Write a story that allows the reader to write their own story, just for the meta-ness nerd cred
73. Test for substrings of commands and if it applies do those
70. Plural/gender/etc. localizations
69. Override variable subscripting, turning variables into special dicts before being passed to eval
68. World object that exists separately for each block (or even just a macro)
67. Actually write the tests
65. Special addressing for the "root" block of a *file* rather than of the whole story
63. Check that insert commands and such are only used with bags
61. Return command for gosub
59. Save current text printed to terminal when file saved
58. SPILL command for when we do want to "spill" from an effects section to the parent area
56. Disallow random intervals in choice specs?
47. no_flavor alternative text
46. Temp variables that are temporary/only relevant within a block, then they're not set anymore/block variables
45. Better gameparser interaction with _args
43. Automatic log of variable changes
41. Pausing on repeat commands when, for example, you no longer have the materials for something, so it doesn't just spam console (maybe also a "max" option)
26. Cost checking with passed args
21. Setting for showing non-taken choices or not
20. Player-defined macros via command line
18. Autocomplete for commands

DONE
86. Implement unflagging
83. Use _default in switch statements
78. Treat footers more like macros that get executed within the blocks (Note: I'm reverting this but it was done)
110. Revert command
71. Re-implement "actions", which are always available choices not presented, but can be analyzed by typing "actions" (they also apply to all sub-blocks, like a footer)
42. Interrupts when commands take too long
36. Autosaves
19. Repeat command to do something many times
15. Show off subroutine capabilities with time advancing subroutine
7. Allow float vars with costs and such
72. Flag command that raises a new boolean var
62. Master _requirement_specification parsing function
60. What to do about vars that change after costs are evaluated? (Figured this out, costs are now evaluated on choice presentation)
54. Keep track of last instruction address for debug purposes in the gameloop
52. Check that grammar disjuncts aren't ambiguous
51. Figure out how to deal with array-valued types
44. Location tracking/where playing "is" between choices
33. Use config file to name game and state globals
31. Write exploration story
27. Debug commands for setting variable values
24. Allow accessing _args out of bound in a more user-friendly manner
23. Basic GUI layout
22. Update 'help' string for new commands (#1 - 5/22/2024)
84. Fix eval not actually evaluating whether all variables in an expression exist
4. Catch exceptions from eval, for things like if statements assume falseness, for set statements don't modify
82. Fix goto . instruction
66. Remove list block/dict block distinction
50. Finish view class implementation for command line
39. Make _content a root type
38. Local _vars on top of blocks
34. Start user guide
9. More specific error parsing messages
14. Implement gosub
29. Basic saving/loading functionality
25. randint import as randint
17. Require tag for choices
16. Highlight for new choices
11. Basic implementation of compound/multi-word choices w/ args
6. Blocks can be lists now (replacement for _content)
5. Make automatic syntax checking from YAML file
3. No keyword needed to do choices, just type them
1. Checking that story is formatted correctly

NOT DOING
64. Check "extra newline" with consecutive print statements
12. If a variable doesn't exist, still instantiate it, but give a warning
76. Change _vars to dict
55. Remove underscores and use protected keywords instead
49. Introduce type annotations (learn them)
48. Recursive searching for block names if there's a unique block with that name or closest one
35. Write a semantics spec (once I get syntax more nailed down) (replaced by user guide)
28. Attach function handlers during parsing
10. Allow loading of other specification files with things like variables and layouts
79. Use Black formatter?
2. Unify actions and choices with actions as just "default choices"

I FORGET WHAT THIS MEANS
13. Allow specification file for author-defined commands
53. Automatic checking for interpreter functions
30. More complicated parsing system; add metadata into game itself and use this to make saving/loading more robust
40. Search command to search for a place
32. For implementing UI, do purely text based commands with passed in print/display functions
57. Automatic stopping outside of effects blocks!

DEFUNCT
37. Add special lib var that is a library accessible to expressions but doesn't get saved with the state
8. Add back in variable sensing?
