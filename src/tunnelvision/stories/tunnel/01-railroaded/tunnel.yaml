Usually, the temperature in the Dome wasn't too bad, but that year was brutal. Director Dicky, the owner of the orphanage, refused to let her in since the place was already so full, and she later became unresponsive and motionless. To his credit, Dicky did let her in at last... to a small graveyard in the orphanage.

        - George opens the doors, allowing the light that permeates the outside of the Dome to flood in.
        - You hunker along with your heavy packs, heading for the gaping miles-wide gap in the Dome's rocky walls. It's the Tunnel, which is the only way out, and today will be your first day exploring it.
        - It's only a day's walk from your small town to the Tunnel.

    tunnel_entrance:
      _content:
        - You reach the entrance to the Tunnel, the only exit from the 100-mile or so Dome to which humanity is confined. From here, you finally get a sense of its true magnitude. It's about half a day's walk from one side to the other, but its width is still nothing compared to its depth. No one has gotten to the end, or at least, no one has gotten to the end and returned. Some even think it never ends. Maybe you'll be the first to prove them wrong.
        - "A guard to the entrance booth checks George's Yellow Pass and your Training Pass. There are multiple reasons for the 10-foot stone wall that bars those without passes from getting through: safety, bureaucracy, tradition, preservation. All you care for, though, is to finally see the lush rolling landscape of the first layer."
        - George is unusually adept at Tunnel exploration. Despite only being only a Yellow Pass holder (already a feat for a 19-year-old like him), he was allowed via special agreement to train you. Also due to his natural ability, it doesn't take long for you both to find a rosalia patch.

        - After a day's work of gathering rosalia, George tells you its time to head home. You're disappointed that your first journey was so short, but he explains he just wanted somethings simple the first time. Then he pats you on the back and says, "You did great".

      - separator:
      - sub: /logic/time
      - The next day, after about 30 minutes of walking, he starts to hike up a steep hill. The Dome is comparatively flat, so you're not used to the steep elevation. George, on the other hand, is able to speed ahead. You're afraid to lose him, but he stops at the top. Then, he turns to look down at you and yells out, "Don't worry, when I was your age, my stamina wasn't so great either." Then he chuckles. "You'll do just fine."
      - He makes it sound like he's had soooo much more time to progress, but really he's only three years older than you.
      - Once you get to the top, you slouch your hands onto your knees and wheeze in and out. When you're done panting, you look up and drop your mouth.

        - In front of you is the largest field of flowers that you've ever seen. And it's glowing! George announces proudly, "I just wanted to show you the lemen patch I always like to use. She's a beauty." He goes on, explaining what lemens are... a bulbous, yellow, luminous plant that dims over time. Also, they're used for lighting across the dome.
        - You ask, "So those bright bulb-y things are what gets put in the orphanage for lighting? But the ones down there are so much brighter." George explains, "Ah, but we usually use cheaper secondhand lemens. I sell the fresh ones I gather for a higher price." To be fair, the lighting is probably one of the smaller concerns at the orphanage anyways.
        - George and you split up to gather lemens. He says lemen-bushels is a good amount. As you start, you notice some rosalia off in the distance.

He was only found out after showing you. Since you were much younger at the time, you didn't understand to be discrete about it, and after several days of being "sick" in a row, Ms. Bee looked more into what was happening and busted you both.

The green pass is the one that's required to go to the first layer alone. George himself has a yellow pass, which allows him into the third layer. George also lays out the day's plans, which are to get to the lemen patch and harvest some lemens.

        - Then, several more appear from your sides, behind, and there are even some that have climbed the trees. "Shorwolves," George mutters. Then, he draws his shortsword. It's the first time you've seen it unsheathed. Immediately, the creatures dart, leaving you free of trouble. George puts his sword back away.

Usually, if they judge you to be more of a threat, they leave you alone, but there are accounts of those less experienced who've been hunted down by those things.
