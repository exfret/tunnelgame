        text: Visit the shop.
    shop:
      - flavor: The shopkeeper is an old man with a stiff, scruffy beard and dark black hair. He grunts when he sees you enter.
      - What would you like to buy?
      - choice: torch
        text: For exploring caves and dark places

    cave:
      _content:
        - print: Cave Encounter
          style: bold
        - flavor: You come across a rock formation jutting up from the ground. Between the rocks is an entrance to a cave. You can barely see inside.
        - choice: inside
          text: Go inside the cave
          require: 1 torch
        - choice: climb

          text: Go around the rocks
      inside:
        _content:
          - It's very dark inside, and one torch is barely enough to see even a few feet in front of you. It's almost as if the darkness is swallowing up the light. Your footsteps patter on some puddles, then you hear a whistle.

        continue:
          - The whistling gets louder and louder. The cave makes a narrow bend and you're sure it's just around the corner. But when you turn, nothing's there... except a whistle laying on a golden pedestal. You decide to pick it up.
          - set: whistle += 1
            show:
          - Afterward, you return home.
          - goto: /town
      climb:
        - You try as hard as you can to climb to the top but it seems you need better fitness for that!

              - goto: /town
            "2":
              - You find a note that says "give me my coins back". It seems like someone was unhappy about you taking the coins last time.
              - choice: return
                text: Return the coins you took
                cost: 3 coin
                effects:
                  - You leave the coins there for the person to pick up again.
              - choice: keep
                text: Keep the coins you took
                effects:

    springs:
      _content:
        - You spot a stream of water coming up from a bubbling source in the ground. Upon further inspection, the water is cold and crisp.
    cabin:
      _content:
        - print: Cabin Encounter
          style: bold
        - flavor: You find a cabin in the woods. You try the door, but it seems to be locked. Upon closer inspection, it seems to have a keyhole in the shape of a whistle.
