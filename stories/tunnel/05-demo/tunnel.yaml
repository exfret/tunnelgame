      - "[[George]] is standing at the dusty entrance to the orphanage, his ruffled brown hair blending with the oak double round-top door that leads outside. He's flipping a coin to pass the time as he waits for you to finish packing for your trip to the [[Tunnel]] with him."

          - Your training [[pass]] is used for entering the Tunnel. You can easily see you can have it by checking the stats panel to your right.

        text: Touch the necklace my parents gave me for comfort
        effects:
          - The necklace is all you have left of your parents. You remember little of them.
          - On the other hand, the hairs knotted to the necklace are tied to a vivid memory. An orphan girl wailing just outside the doorway for a room in winter. Usually, the temperature in the [[Dome]] wasn't too bad, but that year was brutal. Director Dicky, the owner of the orphanage, refused to let her in since the place was already so full, and she later became unresponsive and motionless. To his credit, Dicky did let her in at last... to a small graveyard in the orphanage.
          - You vow to become a great Tunnel [[explorer]], someone who brings back riches and glory. That way, you can provide the funds for anyone to be taken in. You snuck a lock of hair you cut from the poor girl's head as a symbol of your promise.

    _image: path_to_tunnel.png
    _content:
      - You walk along with [[George]] to the gate preventing others from getting hurt by foolishly wandering into the [[Tunnel]] unprepared (though many, including George, swear the real reason is simply so that the Dome's government can regulate and tax [[explorer]]s). Once at the gate, you both show the guard your [[pass]]es and are allowed on.
      - Lately, George has been letting you lead the way with training, but this time he charges right ahead to some unknown location as soon as you get past the gate. You wonder what he has in mind. You almost lose him as he dashes up a large hill, but then when you get to the top, your jaw drops.
      - choice: look
        text: Look out over the hill

  clackadoo:

    _content:
      - It's the largest [[lemen]] field you've ever seen. The glow is incredible. [[George]] speaks to you through the chirps of birds from some nearby trees. "My father was great at catching [[clackadoo]] birds. He left me quite a few feathers when he went on his last trip into the [[Tunnel]]. I decided I'd give one to each mentee I had when they'd finished training. Well, here's your Green Pass. And your feather." George wears an enormous grin on his face. "Congratulations," He says, "you're done with training!" Then, he pulls you in for a big hug.

    - You come across some rocks rising up from the ground. They stick straight up an lean on each other like a house of cards, leaving a hole between them. This hole is the entrance to a cave with an abyssal, dark interior. The ground slopes downward toward the hole, as if to suck you in.
