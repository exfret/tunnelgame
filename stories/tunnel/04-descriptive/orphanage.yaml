          - The necklace is all you have left of your parents. You remember little of them.
          - On the other hand, the hairs knotted to the necklace are tied to a vivid memory. An orphan girl wailing just outside the doorway for a room in winter. Usually, the temperature in the Dome wasn't too bad, but that year was brutal. Director Dicky, the owner of the orphanage, refused to let her in since the place was already so full, and she later became unresponsive and motionless. To his credit, Dicky did let her in at last... to a small graveyard in the orphanage.
          - You vow to become a great Tunnel explorer, someone who brings back riches and glory. That way, you can provide the funds for anyone to be taken in. You snuck a lock of hair you cut from the poor girl's head as a symbol of your promise.
