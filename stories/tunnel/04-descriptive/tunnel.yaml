        - You reach the entrance to the Tunnel, the only exit from the 100-mile or so Dome to which humanity is confined. From here, you finally get a sense of its true magnitude. It's about a quarter of a day's walk from one side to the other, but its width is still nothing compared to its depth. No one has gotten to the end, or at least, no one has gotten to the end and returned. Some even think it never ends. Maybe you'll be the first to prove them wrong.
        - "A guard at the entrance booth checks George's Yellow Pass and your Training Pass. There are multiple reasons for the 10-foot stone wall that bars those without passes from getting through: safety, bureaucracy, tradition, preservation. All you care for, though, is to finally see the lush rolling landscape of the first layer."
        - George is unusually adept at Tunnel exploration. Despite only being only a Yellow Pass holder (already a feat for a 19-year-old like him), he was allowed via special agreement to train you. Also due to his natural ability, it doesn't take long for you both to find a rosalia patch.

        - George teaches you how to pluck the small leaves from the red flower for use in teas. You already know some about the flower due to Mabel's love for it. The orphanage's study doesn't hold many books, but she often goes out of her way to find more for those who are able to fetch her some rosalia.

        - After a day's work of gathering rosalia, George tells you its time to head home. You're disappointed that your first journey was so short, but he explains he just wanted somethings simple the first time. Then he pats you on the back and says, "You did great".

        - George shows his Yellow Pass to the guard, and you hold up your white Training Pass. The guard examines the passes and lets you both through.
        - After another half a day's walk to the place George is leading you to, he starts to hike up a steep hill. The Dome is comparatively flat, so you're not used to the steep elevation. George, on the other hand, is able to speed ahead. You're afraid to lose him, but he stops at the top. Then, he turns to look down at you and yells out, "Don't worry, when I was your age, my stamina wasn't so great either." Then he chuckles. "You'll do just fine."
        - He makes it sound like he's had soooo much more time to progress, but really he's only three years older than you.
        - Once you get to the top, you slouch your hands onto your knees and wheeze in and out. When you're done panting, you gaze out at an amazing sight.

        - In front of you is the largest field of flowers that you've ever seen. And it's glowing! George announces proudly, "I just wanted to show you the lemen patch I always like to use. She's a beauty." He goes on, explaining what lemens are... a bulbous, yellow, luminous plant that dims over time. Also, they're used for lighting across the dome.
        - You ask, "So those bright bulb-y things are what they put in the orphanage for lighting? But the ones down there are so much brighter." George explains, "Ah, but we usually use cheaper secondhand lemens. I sell the fresh ones I gather for a higher price." To be fair, the lighting is probably one of the smaller concerns at the orphanage anyways.

It''s not super bad because the second layer is usually not too dangerous as long as you know what to watch out for, just farther away."'

Technically, that''s not even enough for me to train you: I need a Pioneer Pass, which is for the fourth layer. But the legacy of my parents helped those at the orphanage pull a few strings."'

            - '"I think we just need to get through the Tunnel, honestly. I know it''s dangerous but I believe if we just put more effort into it, we could do it. And getting to the other side and returning is the first step in inspiring people into exploring more."'
