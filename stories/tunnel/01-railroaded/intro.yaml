      - Here, you will see important stats about your character. If not much shows up, then don't fret! You just haven't unlocked those statistics yet.
      - "Awesomeness: Very"
      - "Hair: Red"

        then:
          - 'Energy: Energy is used for some actions, or to do better and observe more opportunities during exploration. Check your energy and other personal stats with the "character" action. You can recover energy through resting/sleeping, but you can only have so much energy at once. Max energy can be increased later.'
      - "Rosalia: Rosalia is a rose-like plant with big, broad, deep red leaves and smaller leaves along its stem. These smaller leaves are often crushed up to create teas."
      - if: encyclopedia_the_light
        then:
          - "The Light: The Dome and first few layers of the Tunnel are permeated with a permanent light. The light fades quickly over short distances, making the insides of buildings very dark without other lighting sources. People still operate on roughly a 24 hour schedule with many careful timepieces, though the meaning for this exact unit of time has been lost."

          - To see more detailed options, try something like "inventory plants". Valid options are "plants" to see plants and "prized" to see prized possessions.

        _default:
          - That's not a valid option for inventory. Valid options are "plants" to see plants and "prized" to see prized possessions.
