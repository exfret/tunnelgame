    george_waiting:
      - You are Lily, an aspiring orphan Tunnel adventurer.
      - George, your mentor, is standing at the dusty entrance to the orphanage, his ruffled brown hair blending with the oak double round-top door that leads outside. He's flipping a coin to pass the time as he waits for you to finish packing.
      - choice: review
        selectable_once:
        text: Review your encyclopedia notes on rosalia
        effects:
          - You're able to navigate to your encyclopedia with the "encyclopedia" command. You read up about rosalia, which you will be gathering with George. You also note that you can also see other actions by typing "info actions", or a complete list of commands by typing "help".

        selectable_once:
        text: Touch the necklace my parents gave me for comfort
        effects:
          - The necklace is all you have left of your parents. You remember little of them.
          - On the other hand, you have vivid memories tied to the hairs knotted around the necklace. They were from an orphan girl who died outside in the cold because the orphanage couldn't take her in.
          - You vow to become a great Tunnel explorer, someone who brings back riches and glory. That way, you can provide the funds for anyone to be taken in. You snuck a lock of hair you cut from the poor girl's head as a symbol of your promise.
          - goto: .
      - choice: ready
        text: Tell George that I'm ready
    ready:
      - George opens the doors, allowing the light that permeates the outside of the Dome to flood in.
      - You both hunker along with your heavy packs, heading for the Tunnel, a gaping miles-wide gap in the Dome's rocky walls. It's only a day's walk from your small town to the Tunnel.
      - George interrupts the silence by asking how you feel about your first trip.
      # Gives a coin or a rosalia
      - choice: anxious
        effects:
          - He gives you a rosalia and says, "Hopefully now that you see what you'll be gathering, you can have a more concrete picture of what we'll be doing. It's nothing too bad!"

    tunnel_entrance:
      - It's a day's journey from your small town to the entrance of the Tunnel.
      - sub: /logic/time
      - You reach the entrance to the Tunnel, the only exit from the hundred mile wide Dome to which humanity is confined. No one has gotten to the end of this Tunnel, some even think it is endless. Maybe you'll prove them wrong one day.
      - A guard checks your Training Pass, which allows you into the Tunnel only under George's supervision. After entering, you both spend the day hiking to the new rosalia patch.
      - George asks you, "What do you like the most about the Tunnel?"
