        text: Touch the necklace my parents gave me for comfort
        effects:
          - The necklace is all you have left of your parents. You remember little of them.
          - On the other hand, you have vivid memories tied to the hairs knotted around the necklace. They were from an orphan girl who died outside in the cold because the orphanage couldn't take her in.
          - You vow to become a great Tunnel explorer, someone who brings back riches and glory. That way, you can provide the funds for anyone to be taken in. You snuck a lock of hair you cut from the poor girl's head as a symbol of your promise.

        text: Tell George that I'm ready
    ready:
      - George opens the doors, allowing the light that permeates the outside of the Dome to flood in.
      - You both hunker along with your heavy packs, heading for the Tunnel, a gaping miles-wide gap in the Dome's rocky walls. It's only a day's walk from your small town to the Tunnel.
      - George interrupts the silence by asking how you feel about your first trip.
